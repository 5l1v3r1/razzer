# Fuzzer

Razzer modifies Syzkaller to take advantages of the modified
hypervisor. It consists of two phases fuzzer, called syz-fuzzer and
syz-scheduler, that each phase runs on an independent virtual machine.

## syz-fuzzer

Syz-fuzzer focuses on identifying a single-thread input program that
executes potential race points generated by the static analysis.
Syz-fuzzer is similar with Syzkaller except that it figure out inputs
that contains two syscalls that execute each instruction of potential
race points, and sends it to syz-scheduler.

## syz-scheduler

Syz-scheduler is constructed with the help from the syz-fuzzer,
utilizing a custom hypervisor to control the thread interleaving
deterministically. It executes a hypercall to install a breakpoint
right before the syscall that execute an instruction of the potential
race point. Syz-scheduler also mutates inputs further that turns out
that a race truly occurs at the potential race points.
